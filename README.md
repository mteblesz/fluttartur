# fluttartur

This project is an implementation of the board game "The Resistance: Avalon" as a mobile app using Flutter. The goal of the app is to simulate a multiplayer game session for 5 to 10 players. It facilitates gameplay in the absence of a physical copy of the game, providing a local multiplayer experience.
